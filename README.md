# reorgmedia
Organize and harmonize your media repository

**reorgmedia** is a suite of bash scripts I created for managing my personal media library. Day after day, subsequent versions of the scripts evolved until they became quite flexible for my needs, so I decided to share them for anyone interested to experiment, suggest improvements and increase current functionalities.
